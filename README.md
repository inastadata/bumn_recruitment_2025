# BUMN Recruitment 2025 Job Scraper

This project contains Python scripts to extract job vacancies from the **BUMN Recruitment 2025** portal. The scripts fetch job vacancy data with and without authentication, process the data, and save it as CSV files for further analysis.

## 📌 Features

- Fetches job vacancies from the **BUMN Recruitment 2025** API.
- Supports both **authenticated** and **unauthenticated** requests.
- Extracts **total applicants** for each job posting.
- Saves data in a structured **CSV format**.
- Implements **rate limiting** to avoid excessive requests.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
git clone https://github.com/inastadata/bumn_recruitment_2025.git
cd bumn_recruitment_2025
	 ```

2.	**Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
```
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```
```
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
3.	**Install dependencies**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🚀 Usage

1️⃣ **Extract job vacancies without authentication**

This script fetches job vacancies without requiring authentication.
```
python scripts/extract_no_auth.py
```
	- The script starts from page 7 and continues fetching jobs until no more vacancies are available.
	- The data is saved to: data/bumn_jobs_no_auth.csv
	- The total number of applicants across all pages is displayed.


2️⃣ **Extract job vacancies with authentication**

This script fetches job vacancies using a Bearer Token for authentication.
```
python scripts/extract_auth.py
```
	- Requires a valid Bearer Token (replace "null" in BEARER_TOKEN).
	- Fetches job listings and their total applicant count.
	- Saves the extracted data to: data/bumn_jobs_auth.csv
	- The total number of applicants for Page 1 is displayed.

🔒 Security Considerations
	- Do not hardcode sensitive credentials in the scripts.
	- Store authentication tokens in a .env file or configuration file that is excluded via .gitignore.
	- Avoid making too many requests in a short period to prevent rate-limiting.

🏗️ Future Improvements
	- Implement multi-page fetching for authenticated requests.
	- Add error handling for API failures.
	- Store credentials securely using environment variables.
